    "Create a program that prints out every line to the song \"99 bottles of beer on the wall.\" This should be a pretty simple program, so to make it a bit harder, here are some rules to follow.\n",
    "\n",
    "###  RULES\n",
    "\n",
    "1. If you are going to use a list for all of the numbers, do not manually type them all in. Instead, use a built in function.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Besides the phrase \"take one down,\" you may not type in any numbers/names of numbers directly into your song lyrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Remember, when you reach 1 bottle left, the word \"bottles\" becomes singular.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Put a blank line between each verse of the song."

    "## Mad Libs Program Rules\n",
    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "Ever played Mad Libs? If you haven't, here's the basic's of it.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Mad Libs consist of a book that has a short story on each page with many key words replaced with blanks. Beneath each blank is specified a lexical or other category, such as \"noun\", \"verb\", \"place\", or \"part of the body\".[10] One player asks the other players, in turn, to contribute some word for the specified type for each blank, but without revealing the context for that word. Finally, the completed story is read aloud. The result is usually comic, surreal and somewhat nonsensical.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "## Goal\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a Mad Libs style game, where the program asks the user for certain types of words, and then prints out a story with the words that the user inputted. The story doesn't have to be too long, but it should have some sort of story line.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tip - It's easiest to write out a quick story on a piece of paper or a word document, and then go back through and see which words the user should be able to change.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Subgoals\n",
    "\n",
    "If the user has to put in a name, change the first letter to a capital letter.\n",
    "\n",
    "Change the word \"a\" to \"an\" when the next word in the sentence begins with a vowel."
